## Welcome to the Cowboy Hat Association 

Who we are: We are hackers who code for the greater.
How we do it: our methodology on the highest level - Think Elegant and Build Fast

Here we gather a group of hackers who can think elegant, build fast, belive they are a part of sth bigger and be willing to code for the greater. Some interesting ideas of think elegant and build fast will be published in this website. 

PS: Cowboy hats are differentiated from black/white/grey/red hats.. We have free will and exceptional skills to ride for the greater good.

#Think Elegant

```markdown
To think elegant is to discover the beautiful ways to construct a mental representation of the problems. The elegance should show simplicity and unusual effectiveness. 

Newton's laws of physics are elegant for they are both *syntactially simple* and *ontological simple*, and *unsually effective* in predicting motions of objects in the assumed scope. 

What are the elegance in vairous industries/knowledge domains and how they make things simpler yet effective?
How to discover them? Or do we have an analytical way to identify them from knowledge base? Let's find out.

#Build Fast (or buildfast, we should have it just like breakfast everyday)
```

### From Break-Fast to Build-Fast
Some best practises and paradigms in designing language and dev environments:
For development we would like to capture the error as early as possible (e.g., compile-time error better than run-time error).
For deployment we would like to capture the error in the DEVOPS pipelien as early as possible, 

These are desirable features to help us identify bugs prior to their propagation to the latter stage of the pipeline. 
However, making our mistakes less costly does not suffice to achieve 100x productivitiy. 
Let's think about build-fast to produce high-performance and error-free codes

### How to build fast without breaking things? 
Methods and techniques all the way up from compilers. Here are some articles:
